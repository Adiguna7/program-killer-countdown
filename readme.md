### problem

I'm too tired to attend meetings but it's mandatory (via zoom, for example webinar). I want to record the meeting that I attended after joining the room, and rest after that. but at the end of the meeting, sometimes the zoom room host calls one by one the participants who didn't leave after the event is over, this is done to make sure whether the participant really participates or not.


that's why i made this simple code

- Windows
  - Directly open `kill.bat`
- Linux
  - Open `terminal`
  - `./kill.sh`


ps: only work if your meeting does not require oncam

you can change the program you want to kill after a certain time from code, for example gmeet, webex etc

⚠️: don't use it as an excuse to be lazy
